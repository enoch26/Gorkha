# Gorkha Earthquake Data Resources

## Description


This repository documents and references various geospatial datasets used for earthquake-induced landslide (EQIL) modelling in Nepal for Gorkha Earthquake. Data includes administrative boundaries, geology, elevation, land cover, rainfall, and landslide inventories.

> **Note:** Some administrative boundaries and datasets are updated periodically. Always verify the latest versions via official portals (e.g., Nepal Survey Department, ICIMOD, USGS, FAO, etc.).

## üèîÔ∏è Digital Elevation Model (DEM)

- [Copernicus 30m DEM (OpenTopography)](https://opentopography.org/news/updated-copernicus-30m-DEM-available)

## Relief Maps

- Channel steepness index and distance metric to channel raster maps of the Gorkha Earthquake 2015-affected area computed from DEM and processed with [LSDTopoTools](https://lsdtopotools.github.io/), see `lsdtopotools_driver` folder for scripts and details.

## üåßÔ∏è Annual Rainfall Data

- [CHIRPS v3 Rainfall Data](https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps3)

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Raster Processing Note

- To fill the gaps caused by buffering between the study area and `nep_geo.shp`, use the script `nepal_geo_rast_fill.R`. This applies nearest-neighbour interpolation to ensure full coverage in the Gorkha district, making the raster suitable for subsequent spatial analysis.

---
## R code

- `compiler.R`: compiles and processes various geospatial datasets into a unified format for analysis and INLA spatial modelling.
- `tile_ldsize.R`: Plots the landslide inventory with PGA contour lines and histogram for landslides. 
- `mchi.R`: Plots the normalised channel steepness index (ksn) and channel profile analysis.
- `pred_zm.R`: Plots the posterior susceptibility map zoom-out.
- `coefvar.R`: Plots the coefficient of variation for the intensity and covariate effect maps.
