There are some up to date examples of the maps that we have been generating as part of our DFID project in Nepal here:

In particular, the timeseries (‘landslide hazard map’) is probably the best place to start. On this webpage, there is an example of this map and the others that we produce, for the Bhote Kosi palika:

  …but you can find maps for all 135 palikas in the ‘14 earthquake’ districts also if there is somewhere of particular interest, further down the page. I’ve let you know when the 1st paper on this is available.



The New Zealand study I mentioned is written up here (if you cannot find access to the data, let me know):

The wider USGS open repository of earthquake triggered landslide datasets is here:

On the coastal rockfalls, the best place to start is probably the following two papers which summarise part of this work and explore the initial 9 months of data from this system (we now have c 5 years of data to analyse…):
  
  
  
  https://www.earth-surf-dynam.net/6/101/2018/ (this is quite methods focused around the change detection, but the discussion starts to get into a data a little more)



https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019JF005225 (this is around the influence of monitoring intervals on what we understand about magnitude frequency)



There is more detail on this analysis in the following thesis: http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/12172/ which includes some interesting stuff on patterns and in particularly pre-cursors to failure (pages 221 - ).
